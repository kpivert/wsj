What’s the Impact of Eliminating Medicaid Provider Taxes?

Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, and states are required to fund a portion of total
spending. States are currently permitted to tax health care providers up to 6% to help fund the
state share. A potential Medicaid reform would lower this threshold—potentially to 0%—and
thus reduce federal Medicaid funding for many states. The Congressional Budget Oﬃce estimates
that reducing the threshold to 0% would lead to $612 billion in federal savings over 10 years.

How would this impact federal Medicaid spending in individual states?

How do provider taxes work?

Almost every state has at least one type of provider
tax. States use provider tax revenue to partially
ﬁnance their share of total Medicaid spending.

Provider tax revenue and federal matching revenue,
based on the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage
(FMAP), is then returned to the state’s health system
and used for a variety of purposes.

Currently, states are permitted to eﬀectively collect up to 6% of net patient revenue per provider
class. This is referred to as the “safe harbor” limit.

States with high FMAP & high provider tax rates would be
most aﬀected if the safe harbor limit is removed.

The impact of removing the 6% provider tax threshold
depends on each state’s provider tax rates and FMAP:
  Higher provider tax rates translate to a higher

state share of Medicaid spending.

  Higher FMAP translates to a higher federal

match on the state share and thus more total
Medicaid funding.

Data and methods
Provider tax rates are imputed from Kaiser Family Foundation. We use the lower bound of each tax rate range
for states with a provider tax in place and assume a 1.0% rate if it is presented as ≤3.5%. Although 19 classes
of providers can be subject to provider taxes, we focus on nursing facilities (NFs) and hospitals. Therefore,
these estimates likely understate true eﬀects.

Total net patient revenue data by state for general, short-term hospitals are from FY 2023 Medicare Cost
Reports and FY 2021 Medicare Cost Reports for nursing facilities. We calculate blended FY 2023 FMAPs and
use FY 2023 total Medicaid expenditure from the Medicaid Budget and Expenditure System, and use
traditional FMAPs from Kaiser Family Foundation. Where necessary, we use a 3% growth rate assumption to
trend quantities to FY 2026.

If provider taxes are eliminated, at least $83.7 billion in annual
federal Medicaid funding is at risk in FY 2026.

What does this mean?
Based on tax revenue collected from hospitals and nursing facilities, states will collect at least $83.7
billion in federal funding for their Medicaid programs in FY 2026. If the safe harbor threshold is
eliminated, states will be required to ﬁnd alternative sources of state Medicaid funding, or else lose
this federal funding. This will not impact states equally. The elimination of the 6% safe harbor
threshold means that several states (Mississippi, South Carolina, Utah, Alabama, New Hampshire,
Tennessee, and Iowa) could lose over 30% of their total Medicaid federal funding.

Notes: Florida did not report tax rates, but we imputed nursing facility and hospital tax rates based on correspondence. While this analysis accounts for tax revenue from hospital and
nursing facilities, there are other potential sources of tax revenue that we do not include in this analysis. Additionally, the CBO assumes that states will replace half of the lost provider tax
revenues with other sources of state funding, but this analysis does not include this assumption. Authors: Morgan Henderson (mhenderson@hilltop.umbc.edu), Leigh Goetschius, and
Alice Middleton. With sincere thanks to Dunc Williams of the Medical University of South Carolina for providing the state-level nursing facility net patient revenue data.
